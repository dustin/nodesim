<p>
  We had a worst case of {{worst_loss}} lost vbuckets.  Excluding the
  runs where we lost no data, our remaining loss distribution looked
  like this:

<h2>With {{size}} Nodes Failing</h2>
<p>
  There were {{total}} incidents of {{size}} nodes failing.  In the
  worst case, we lost <span id="worst_loss_{{size}}">a few</span>
  vbuckets.

  This chart shows the number of times we lost the given number of
  vbuckets.  A total
  of <span id="loss_count_{{size}}">something</span> vbuckets were
  lost during these {{total}} tests.
